How to find the best ML candidates for the job

Here are the top qualities Google ML engineers all share

**They have a keen understanding of distributed systems architecture.**

Machine learning workloads can be massive, requiring large datasets, parallel data processing, and distributed training. Knowing how to effectively harness storage, network, and compute resources can significantly speed up the process and reduce costs.

**They decompose ML solutions into a modular architecture**
Similar to software development, modularity is also important when deploying machine learning systems. It not only enables team members to work efficiently on individual parts, it also encourages reusability for other teams or future projects. 

**They recognize the value of testing. **
A top-tier ML engineer will emphasize rigorous testing at each stage of the ML production process, from validating input data to model performance to integration code.

**They always keep security top of mind.** 
AI and ML introduce a unique set of security risks due to automation, massive volumes of complex data, and managing and processing workloads in the cloud. ML engineers need to consistently apply a security mindset to ML development processes, ensuring that all training data, tools, and communication channels are secured and managed properly.

**They are great communicators.**
Machine learning engineers work at the intersection of multiple disciplines, so effective communication is essential. They will need to explain status, risks, trade-offs, and much more to different audiences, including data scientists, developers, managers, and business users.

**They understand what ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù is.**
There are so many things that can be improved and automated in an ML system, but it‚Äôs important to be able to recognize when the effort is exceeding the value. Great ML engineers need to maintain focus on the goals and objectives of a project‚Äîand they are pragmatic about when it‚Äôs time to stop. Often they will find greater return on investment by moving onto the next model versus spending the time necessary to fit the current model perfectly.

**They voice their needs clearly. **
Likewise, an ML engineer should speak up when they need internally-focused tools and productivity enhancements. The business always wants more features as soon as possible, but often fails to provide the tools or processes required to make it happen. The majority of models take 1-11 weeks to deploy a single ML model, and 26% of practitioners believe that delays can be caused by lack of executive buy-in. ML engineers may be required to make tough asks for investments in areas that won‚Äôt pay off right away, but will ultimately allow them to be more productive in the long-term.

**They are flexible.**
Machine learning projects can hit all kinds of roadblocks, such as getting access to sufficient data or building models that aren't accurate enough to meet business needs. Being able to easily change tactics to overcome obstacles without getting frustrated or losing sight of the final goal is key for being able to deliver projects. Demonstrated flexibility with respect to tooling is also an asset. Experience with more than one framework, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn, is another positive signal in top talent.

**They are curious and creative problem solvers.**
It is inevitable that things will go wrong, and the best ML engineers will need to creatively look at machine learning, data, and software elements of problems. Sometimes, an issue might appear to be a data science problem (false positives) when it‚Äôs actually a subtle issue hidden further upstream in the ML pipeline that is leading to poor results. A strong ML engineer has to be comfortable with investigating across a spectrum of possible root causes and have the perseverance to keep asking questions.

**They are strong mentors.**
As there are so many opportunities for growth in this new field, an exceptional ML engineer acts as a mentor for others by sharing their unique perspective and knowledge. Their experience working with complex systems and diverse stakeholders makes them a great source of wisdom within the organization.


**They have a humble approach.**
AI is changing rapidly and our world is not static. We try to consciously remember that we are always learning, and while it‚Äôs an unreachable goal to certify a product as perfect, we can always improve. ML practitioners must make difficult decisions over time, such as when Google removed gender labels from our Cloud Vision API. These changes can be hard to explain, both internally and externally, but great ML engineers honor the complex reality of advanced technologies. Having a passion for diversity of input and fostering a culture of support distinguishes average from excellent ML engineers.
